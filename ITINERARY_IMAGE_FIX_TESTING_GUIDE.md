# Itinerary Image Fix - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- Itinerary images were not displaying in TourDetailPage
- File objects were being stored instead of image URLs
- No Cloudinary upload was happening for itinerary images

### Solution:
1. **TWO OPTIONS for Image**: Now you can either paste URL OR upload file
2. **Cloudinary Upload**: File uploads go to Cloudinary automatically
3. **URL Storage**: Image URLs (not File objects) are stored in the database
4. **Live Preview**: Images show preview immediately after paste/upload
5. **Admin Thumbnail**: Uploaded images show as thumbnails in the admin form
6. **TourDetailPage Display**: Images display properly in the itinerary section
