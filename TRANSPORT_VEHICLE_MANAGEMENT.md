# Transport Vehicle Management Feature

## Overview
Added a smart "Add Vehicle" button system to the Transport Details section in AdminPostDashboard that allows administrators to add multiple transport vehicles without disturbing the existing codebase structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. New State Management
- **Added `savedTransportVehicles` state**: An array to store multiple transport vehicles
- Location: Line 140 in `src/pages/admin/AdminPostDashboard.tsx`

### 2. New Functions

#### `addTransportVehicle()` (Line 593-641)
- Validates that at least transport type is selected
- Creates a new vehicle object with:
  - Unique ID (timestamp-based)
  - Transport Type
  - Transport Year/Modal
  - Make & Variant
  - Capacity
  - Price (USD)
- Adds vehicle to `savedTransportVehicles` array
- **Automatically resets transport form fields** after saving
- Shows success toast notification

#### `removeTransportVehicle(id)` (Line 640-647)
- Removes a vehicle from the saved list by ID
- Shows success toast notification

### 3. Updated UI Components

#### Add Vehicle Button (Line 2473-2482)
- Blue button with Plus icon
- Positioned at the end of transport form fields
- Triggers `addTransportVehicle()` function

#### Saved Transport Vehicles Preview (Line 2485-2513)
- Shows count of saved vehicles
- Lists all saved vehicles with:
  - Sequential numbering
  - Full vehicle details (Type, Year, Make/Variant, Capacity)
  - Delete button for each vehicle
- Only displays when vehicles are saved

#### Current Form Preview (Line 2516-2531)
- Yellow-highlighted box showing current unsaved vehicle
- Reminds user to click "Add Vehicle" to save
- Only shows when form has data

### 4. Integration with Form Lifecycle

#### Form Submit (Line 1138)
- **Includes `transportVehicles`** in tour data sent to API
- Logs saved transport vehicles for debugging

#### Form Reset (Line 1329)
- **Clears `savedTransportVehicles`** when form is reset
- Ensures clean state for new tours

#### Edit Mode (Line 1383-1388)
- **Loads existing transport vehicles** when editing a tour
- Populates `savedTransportVehicles` from tour data
- Falls back to empty array if no vehicles exist

## User Workflow

1. **Fill in vehicle details**:
   - Select Transport Type (required)
   - Select Transport Year (optional)
   - Enter Make & Variant (optional)
   - Enter Capacity (optional)
   - Enter Price in USD (optional)

2. **Click "Add Vehicle" button**:
   - Vehicle is saved to the list
   - Form fields are automatically cleared
   - Success notification appears

3. **Add more vehicles**:
   - Repeat steps 1-2 for each additional vehicle
   - All vehicles are shown in the preview section

4. **View saved vehicles**:
   - See all added vehicles in the preview area
   - Each vehicle can be removed individually

5. **Submit form**:
   - All saved vehicles are included in the tour data
   - Vehicles are stored with the tour in the database

## Key Features

✅ **Smart Design**: Follows existing codebase patterns (similar to pricing schedule management)
✅ **Non-Destructive**: Doesn't disturb existing structure or functionality
✅ **User-Friendly**: Clear visual feedback with color-coded sections
✅ **Flexible**: Can add unlimited vehicles
✅ **Persistent**: Vehicles are saved with tour data and loaded in edit mode
✅ **Clean UX**: Auto-reset after adding each vehicle
✅ **Validation**: Requires at least transport type to be selected

## Technical Details

- **State Type**: Array of objects with `id`, `transportType`, `transportModal`, `makeVariant`, `capacity`, `price`
- **ID Generation**: Uses `Date.now()` for unique IDs
- **Form Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing form submission flow
- **Edit Mode Support**: Loads and displays existing vehicles when editing tours
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback using existing toast system
- **UI Enhancement**: Number input spinners removed from Capacity and Price fields for cleaner interface

## Files Modified

- `src/pages/admin/AdminPostDashboard.tsx` (Single file modification)

## Visual Layout

The transport section now includes a price field:
