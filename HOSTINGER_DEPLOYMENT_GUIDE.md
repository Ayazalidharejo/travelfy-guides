# 🚀 Hostinger Deployment Guide for www.karvaantours.com

## ✅ Complete Setup for Your Domain: **www.karvaantours.com**

## 📦 Build Your Project

### Step 1: Create Production Build

Run this command in your project directory:

```bash
npm run build:production
```

**This will create a `dist` folder with all your production files.**

### Build Output Location:
```
📁 c:\Users\AL REHMAN LAPTOP\Desktop\two-in-one\travelfy-guides\dist
```

**This is the folder you'll upload to Hostinger!**

---

## 📂 What's in the `dist` Folder?

After running the build command, you'll get:

```
dist/
├── index.html              ← Main HTML file
├── .htaccess              ← Apache configuration (for routing)
├── assets/                ← All your JS, CSS, images
│   ├── index-xxxxx.js     ← Bundled JavaScript
│   ├── index-xxxxx.css    ← Bundled CSS
│   ├── vendor-xxxxx.js    ← React, React Router
│   ├── firebase-xxxxx.js  ← Firebase libraries
│   └── other assets...
└── logo.png, favicon.ico  ← Static assets
```

## 🌐 Hostinger Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Access Hostinger File Manager

1. Log in to your Hostinger account
2. Go to **hPanel** → **File Manager**
3. Navigate to **public_html** folder

### Step 2: Clean public_html (if needed)

If there are existing files, either:
- Delete them (backup first!)
- Or use a subfolder

### Step 3: Upload Your Files

**Option A: Upload via File Manager**
1. Click **Upload Files**
2. Select ALL files from your `dist` folder
3. Upload everything to `public_html`

**Option B: Upload via FTP**
1. Use FileZilla or similar FTP client
2. Connect to your Hostinger FTP
3. Upload ALL files from `dist` to `public_html`

### Step 4: Verify .htaccess

Make sure `.htaccess` file is uploaded and visible in `public_html`.

**If you don't see it:**
- Enable "Show Hidden Files" in File Manager settings
- Verify the file is in your `dist` folder before uploading

## 🔧 Firebase Configuration for Production

### Important: Add Your Domain to Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: **karvaan-tour**
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains**
4. Click **Add domain**
5. Add: `karvaantours.com`
6. Add: `www.karvaantours.com`
7. Save!

**Without this, Google Authentication won't work on your live site!**

---

## 🌍 Domain Configuration

Your domain is already set: **www.karvaantours.com**

### DNS Settings (Should already be configured):

If you need to configure:
1. Go to Hostinger → **Domains**
2. Select **karvaantours.com**
3. DNS/Nameservers should point to Hostinger

**Default DNS Records:**
```
A Record:    @ → Your Hostinger IP
A Record:    www → Your Hostinger IP
```

## 🔐 SSL/HTTPS Configuration

### Enable SSL in Hostinger:

3. Select your domain: **karvaantours.com**
4. Click **Install SSL** (Free Let's Encrypt)
5. Wait 15-30 minutes for activation

### Force HTTPS:

Add this to your `.htaccess` (already included in the file I created):

```apache
# Force HTTPS
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```
